** THz processing project **
A colaboration between Andrew Burnett and Stuart Warriner at the Unviersity of Leeds, UK to develop interactive processing tools for THz spectra
Stage 1 was to create an interactive tool to apply window functions, zero pad and FT the data which was realised using Dash to get rapid updates.
The Dash viewer can be used interactively within an ipynb.  It has also been wrapped with a data uploader to give a dash app deployed on render https://thz.onrender.com/
(free tier only for now!).
